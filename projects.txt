Level 1-3: Basic Python Concepts and Automation
File Organizer: Create a script that organizes files in a directory by categorizing them into folders based on file types (e.g., images, documents, archives).
Automated Backup System: Develop a simple backup script that copies files from one location to another, scheduling the backup periodically.
Network Health Checker: Write a script that pings a list of servers and reports their status, automating the process of server health checks.
Level 4-6: Scripting and Data Manipulation
Log Analysis Tool: Build a script to parse log files, extracting specific information or patterns from them.
Automated Report Generator: Create a script to generate reports from structured data (CSV, JSON, or database), performing data analysis and generating insights.
Web Scraping Tool: Develop a web scraper using libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to extract data from a website and save it into a file or database.
Level 7-8: DevOps Automation and Tools
Infrastructure Provisioning Script: Write a script using cloud provider SDKs (e.g., AWS Boto3) to automate the provisioning of infrastructure resources like EC2 instances or S3 buckets.
Deployment Automation with Ansible: Use Ansible to automate deployment tasks, such as configuring servers, deploying applications, or managing services across multiple nodes.
Level 9-10: Advanced DevOps and Deployment
Microservices Orchestration with Docker & Kubernetes: Create a microservices architecture and use Docker for containerization, orchestrate them using Kubernetes, managing deployments, scaling, and network configurations.
Full CI/CD Pipeline Implementation: Build a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline incorporating various tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. Automate the build, test, and deployment processes across different environments.
These projects cater to various aspects of DevOps, automation, data manipulation, and infrastructure management, gradually introducing more complex Python programming challenges as you progress through the levels. They offer opportunities to work with libraries, APIs, automation tools, and deployment technologies, which are valuable skills for a DevOps engineer.
